## Cargo commands

- Make sure you are in the right directory: `cd first_cargo_proj`
- Build project for debugging: `cargo build`
- Build project for a release: `cargo build --release`
- Build and Run project: `cargo run`
- Check for errors: `cargo check`

## Things to note:

I have left the `target` folder inside the `first_cargo_prog` for reference. Don't push this to git.

Thanks!
